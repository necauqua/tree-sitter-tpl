# Tree-sitter grammar for TPL

TPL (Twitch Plays Lisp) is a work-in-progress simple Lisp-like language I am
working on to replace TPN (Twitch Plays Noita) Script used in my 
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/necauqua) chat for programmable chat commands and
macros.

This is a [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for
it, to be used as a reader in the actual implementation as well as for syntax
highlighting in editors that support Tree-sitter based highlighting/movement.

Very WIP.
